== Buffer Allocation Performance

[TIP]
====
._Reproduce Test_
```javascript
$ bench-runner -g "buffer allocation"
```
====

In this test, we allocate Node.js `Buffer` objects of increasing sizes from 2KiB to 32MiB
in steps of powers of 2. `Buffers` are allocated via `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`.

The graph below shows the performance of allocation vs `Buffer` size (higher performance
means faster allocation; both axes are `log10`):

[NOTE]
====
._Size Matters_
Smaller buffers are allocated faster.
====

From the graph:

* Smaller buffers are allocated faster.
* Allocation performance appears to be inversely proportional to buffer size.
